find_when_you_were_near
=======================

A mini project to find when you were near a given location. 
This project came about when I really wanted to remeber which day did I visit a certain bar.

Input is a KML file. I have tested it with google location history.

Try it out here: http://intecolab.com:15000/

To run just do:
	
	python server.py
